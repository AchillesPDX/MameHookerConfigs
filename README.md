This is a collection of ini files and scripts for Mame Hooker as well as some AutoHotKey scripts to work with mainly the Retro Shooter RS3 Reaper light guns. Other light gun and lighting configuration files may also be included, but I have no way to test them and can't confirm whether they work or not.

If you're using the Retro Shooter RS3 Reaper light guns you will need to either modify the `rs3_setcoms.mhs` script file to use the COM ports that your guns are set to, or modify the COM ports of your guns to match the `rs3_setcoms.mhs` script file.

My Reapers are set to COM 6 and COM 7 if you want to change yours to match mine.
