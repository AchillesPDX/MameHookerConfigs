This is a collection of ini files and scripts for Mame Hooker to work with the Retro Shooter RS3 Reaper light guns.

You will need to either modify the ini and script files to use the COM ports that your guns are set to, or modify the COM ports of your guns to match these ini and script files.

My guns are set to COM 6 and COM 7 if you want to change yours to match mine.
